    Congratulations! You have successfully built a real, interactive chatbot. You learned the three most important concepts for building chatbots in Streamlit:

    - **`st.chat_message`**: To display conversation history in a clean, professional way.

    - **`st.session_state`**: To give your app "memory" and store the chat history across interactions.

    - **`st.chat_input`**: The primary widget for capturing user input in a conversational app.

    You can now use this template to build much more complex bots!
